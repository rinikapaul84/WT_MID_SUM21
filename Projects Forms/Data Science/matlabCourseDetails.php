      <td>How do you learn how to program in MATLAB? Sure, you can watch some tutorial videos online, but those videos generally focus on the most basic coding skills, like what is a variable and how to write a for-loop.Those are important foundations, but they won't make you competitive. If you want to be competitive, you need to become a master at MATLAB programming. And that's what you'll learn in this course. This course is different from other MATLAB programming courses!
