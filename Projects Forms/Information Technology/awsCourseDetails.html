      <td>This course is different from the other ones. It covers in-depth all the new topics on the AWS Certified Developer Associate DVA-C01 exam. It's packed with practical knowledge on how to use AWS inside and out as a developer. It teaches you how to prepare for the AWS exam AND how to prepare for the real world. It's a logical progression of topics, not a laundry list of random services. It's fast-paced and to the point.
